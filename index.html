  <p>JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard</p>
  <code></code>
   <ul>
  <li>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
 
  <section class="main-section" id="introduction"><header>Introduction</header>
  <p>JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.</p>
  <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.</p>
  <code></code>
  <ul>
  <li>While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. </li>
  </ul>

  </section>
  
 <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java"><header>JavaScript and Java</header> 
  <p>Both javascript and java require the developer to code in terms of objects and their relationships to one another.</p>
  <p>Both languages can be used in aspects of front-end development. JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML, implemented as a framework or library; Java can be used as a Java applet.</p>
<code></code>
<ul>
<li>Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. </li>
<li>Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. 
  </li>
</ul>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="variables"><header>Variables</header>
  <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p>
  <p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
  <code></code>
  <ul>
  <li> A single variable can not be use with difference code in that particular page.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="hello_world"><header>Hello World</header>
  <p>To start writing JavaScript, an editor is require such as VS code.</p>
  <p>JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the script tag.Example:
   <scrip>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script> 

</p>
  <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>
         <ul>
  <li>These days, CSS has become more than just a design language, though. You can actually implement animations and smooth transitions with just CSS.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="loops"><header>Loops</header>
  <p>
  Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
  </p>
  <p>
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
<ul>
 <li> for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
 <li> for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
 <li> for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
 <li> while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
 <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true </li>
 </ul>
  </p>
  <code></code>
